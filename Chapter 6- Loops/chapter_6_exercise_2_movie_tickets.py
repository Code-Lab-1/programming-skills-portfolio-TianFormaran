#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if

#they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their

#age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket

prompt = "\nWhat is your age?"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' when you are finished. "

while True:
    age = input(prompt)

        break
    age = int(age)

        print("  Your ticket is $10.")

        print("  Your ticket is $15.")
